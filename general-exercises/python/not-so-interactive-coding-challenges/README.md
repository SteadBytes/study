# (Not So) Interactive Coding Challenges

My solutions to the excellent [Interactive Coding Challenges](https://github.com/donnemartin/interactive-coding-challenges) by Donne Martin, but without the interactive notebooks. The project is fantastic and I greatly appreciate the effort Donne (and others) have put into it. For my own studying, however, I prefer to work with plain text Python files that are easily version controllable.
