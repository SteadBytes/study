//! Demonstration of using the `Mutex<T>` smart pointer for *shared-state*
//! concurrency as well as `Arc<T>` to enable multiple threads to share a
//! `Mutex<T>` The Rust type system enforces the invariants required for a
//! mutex to safely guard shared memory:
//! 1. You must attempt to acquire the lock before using the data.
//! 2. When youâ€™re done with the data that the mutex guards, you must unlock the
//! data so other threads can acquire the lock.
