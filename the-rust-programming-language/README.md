# The Rust Programming Language

Notes, exercises and projects for studying [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html) by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols.

Organisation:

- `notes`: Funnily enough contains notes. These are _non-comprehensive_ (i.e. only where I felt it necessary for my learning process) notes on chapters throughout the book.
- `projects`: Code examples and explorations from each chapter as well as the
  few larger projects set in the book.
  - This should probably be better organised...
