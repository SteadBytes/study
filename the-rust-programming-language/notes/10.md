# Generic Data Types

See `projects/generics` for examples.

Abstraction to create definitions for functions, structs, e.t.c.
that can operator with many different _concrete_ types.

- i.e. Haskell type parameters

- Zero cost using _monomorphisation_

**Monomorphisation** = Process of transforming _generic_ code into specific code by filling in the concrete types that are actually used in the program at compile time.

- Compiler creates concrete implementations of generic code for each type that it's used with
- No runtime cost as there is no dynamic dispatch/reflection e.t.c. being performed

For example, usage of the generic `Option<T>` enum:

```rust
fn main() {
    let integer = Some(5);
    let string = Some(String::from("hello"));
}
```

Is monomorphised to:

```rust
enum Option_i32 {
    Some(i32),
    None,
}

enum Option_String {
    Some(String),
    None,
}

fn main() {
    let integer = Option_i32::Some(5);
    let string = Option_String::Some(String::from("hello"));
}
```

# Traits

Specify the functionality that a particular type has and can share with other types

- i.e. Haskell type classes or Java/C++/C# interfaces (though with differences)

See `projects/traits`

# Validating References with Lifetimes

**Lifetime**: The scope for which a reference is valid

- _Every_ reference has an associated lifetime
- Usually implicit and inferred
- Need to be specified when the lifetimes could be related in multiple ways

Main aim is to **prevent dangling references**. In this example, `y` does not "live long enough":
