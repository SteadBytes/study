# Packages and Crates

- **Crate** = A binary or library
- **Crate root** = Source file that compilation starts from
  - Makes up the _root module_ of the crate
- **Package** = One or more creates providing a set of functionality
  - `Cargo.toml` file defines how to build the crates

Packages _must_ contain exactly **0 or 1** library crates

- Can contain **any number** of binary crates

`src/main.rs` = Library crate root

`src/lib.rs`= Binary crate root

`src/bin` = Directory where _multiple_ binary crates are defined

# Modules

Organise code and define **privacy boundaries**

`mod` keyword

All items in Rust are _private by default_
- `pub` keyword to make public
