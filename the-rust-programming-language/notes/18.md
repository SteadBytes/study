# Patterns and Matching

**Patterns** = syntax for matching against the _structure_ of types.

- Provide control flow when used with `match` expressions and other constructs

Patterns use the following components to describe the shape of data:

- Literals
- Destructured arrays, enums, structs or tuples
- Variables
- Wildcards
- Placeholders

Generally very similar to Haskell destructuring and pattern matching.

## All the Places Patterns Can Be Used

- `match` arms
  ```rust
  match VALUE {
      PATTERN => EXPR,
      PATTERN => EXPR,
      PATTERN => EXPR,
  }
  ```
  - Must be _exhaustive_
    - Include a catch-all pattern for the last arm
  - `_` pattern will match anything
    - Doesn't bind to a variable
    - Used to ignore any value not specified in other match arms
      - Catch-all pattern
- Conditional `if let` expressions

  ```rust
    fn main() {
        // Would be received via I/O
        let favorite_color: Option<&str> = None;
        let age: Result<u8, _> = "34".parse();
        // Would be set programatically
        let is_tuesday = false;

        if let Some(color) = favorite_color {
            println!("Using your favorite color, {}, as the background", color);
        } else if is_tuesday {
            println!("Tuesday is green day!");
        } else if let Ok(age) = age {
            if age > 30 {
                println!("Using purple as the background color");
            } else {
                println!("Using orange as the background color");
            }
        } else {
            println!("Using blue as the background color");
        }
    }
  ```

  - More expressive than `match`
  - Can be combined with `else`, `if let`, `else if`, `else if let` for more complex conditional logic
  - Compiler **doesn't check** exhaustiveness

- `while let` conditional loops

  ```rust
  fn main() {
    let mut stack = vec![1, 2, 3];

    while let Some(top) = stack.pop() {
        println!("{}", top);
    }
  }
  ```

  - Allows a `while` loop to run for as long as a pattern _continues to match_

- `for` loops

  ```rust
  fn main() {
    let mut stack = vec![1, 2, 3];

    // (i, v) is the pattern
    for (i, v) in v.iter().enumerate() {
        println!("{} is at index {}", v, i)
    }
  ```

  - Pattern is the value that directly follows the keyword `for`
    - `for x in y` -> `x` is the pattern

- `let` statements
  ```rust
  // let PATTERN = EXPR;
  fn main(){
      let (x, y, z) = (1, 2, 3);
      // This won't compile!
      // Number of binding variables in the pattern doesn't match the number
      // of items in the value being matched.
      // let (x, y) = (1, 2, 3);
      let (x, y, _) = (1, 2, 3);
  }
  ```
- Function parameters

  ```rust
  // x is a pattern
  fn foo(x: i32) {
      // Some code
  }

  // Pattern destructures a tuple and binds the elements to x and y
  fn print_coordinates(&(x, y): &(i32, i32)) {
    println!("Current location: ({}, {})", x, y);
  }

  fn main() {
    let point = (3, 5);
    print_coordinates(&point);
  }
  ```

# Refutability: Whether a Pattern Might Fail to Match

**Irrefutable** pattern: A pattern that will match _any_ possible value.

- `let x = 5;`
- Function parameters, `let` statements and `for` loops _only_ accept irrefutable patterns

**Refutable** pattern: A pattern that will fail to match some possible value.

- `if let Some(x) = a_value`
  - `None` will not match

`if let` and `while let` accept both refutable and irrefutable patterns.

- Compiler will warn when irrefutable patterns are used
