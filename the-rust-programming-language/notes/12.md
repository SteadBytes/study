## Separation of Concerns for Binary Projects

Steps for splitting separate concerns from `main`:

1. Split the program into a `main.rs` and a `lib.rs` and move program logic into `lib.rs`

   - `main.rs` = running the program, should be small enough to verify correctness
     simply by reading it.
   - `lib.rs` = logic of the task itself ('business logic')

2. CLI parsing logic can remain in `main.rs` _as long as it remains small_
3. Extract CLI parsing logic into `lib.rs` if it becomes complex

`main` should be limited to:

1. Calling CLI parsing logic w/argument values
2. Setting up other config
3. Calling a `run` function in `lib.rs`
4. Handling the `error` if `run` returns one
