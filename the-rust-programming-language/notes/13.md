# Closures

Anonymous functions that can _capture_ their environment

- i.e. any form of lambda/anonymous/nested function in Haskell, Clojure, Lisp

Define using `||`:

```rust
let add_one = |x| x + 1;

let also_add_one = |x| {
    x + 1
};
```

Closures _don't require_ type annotations

- Compile type inference is sufficient as closures _should be short_ and _relevant within a narrow context_
- Unlike `fn` functions which are an explicit interface and should be rigidly enforced
- Can add type annotations if it would be clearer

# Iterators

**Lazy** iteration over a sequence of items.

- i.e. Clojure `seq`, Python iterators, Haskell (and similar) `fold` e.t.c.

```rust
let v1 = vec![1, 2, 3];
let v1_iter = v1.iter();

for x in v1_iter {
    println!{"Got: {}", val);
}
```

```

Implemented with the `Iterator` trait from the standard library.

- Provides the `next` method
  - i.e. Python `__next__`

`Iterator` provides several types of methods:

- **Consuming adaptors** = Methods that call `next` on an iterator i.e. `sum`

  - Calling them _uses up_ the iterator
  - **Strict** evaluation

- **Iterator adaptors** = Change an iterator into a different type of iterator i.e. `map`
  - **Lazy** evaluation
