# Publishing a Crate to Crates.io

Documentation comments (`///`) are used to automatically generate HTML documentation for a crate.

- Intended to document _how_ to use the public API

  - Not how it's implemented, use normal comments (`//`) for this

- Support markdown
- Place just before the item being documented

Common sections to include:

- `# Examples`
- `# Panics`
- `# Errors`
- `# Safety`
  - Explain how _unsafe_ code should be used in order to be safe

`cargo test` will run code examples in documentation comments

`//!` adds documentation to the item _containing_ the comments

- Instead of the item _following_ the comments as with `///`

`cargo publish` publishes a crate to crates.io

# Cargo Workspaces

See `projects/workspaces`

Helps manage multiple related packages that can be developed in tandem

- Useful when a crate grows to need multiple library crates
