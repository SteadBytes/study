# Signals, Interrupts and Exceptions

![](https://dpzbhybb2pdcj.cloudfront.net/mcnamara/v-11/Figures/ch10-venn.png)

**Signal**:

- Software level abstraction
- Basic IPC mechanism
- Contain no *content* but their presence is an indicator of *something*

**Interrupt**

- CPU/hardware level abstraction
- **Synchronous interrupts** (exceptions):
  - Generated by CPU during processing as a result of illegal instructions or
    invalid memory access
- **Asynchronous interrupts**:
  - Generated by hardware devices e.g. keyboards, sensors etc.
  - Can occur at any time
  - Can be generated by software

Interrupts can be *specialised* e.g. to allow the OS the opportunity to recover
from the issue e.g. CPU *trap*.


**Note**: Programs in this chapter **treat signals as interrupts**

- Avoids the need to manipulate the OS kernel
  - Required to handle CPU interrupts
- Programming model between the two is similar enough that demonstrating one
  is pedagogically sufficient to be applicable to both
- General pattern:
  - Model application standard control flow
  - Model interrupted control flow
    - Identify resources that need to be cleanly shut down upon interrupt
  - Write interrupt/signal handler
    - Should be fast; update some state then return quickly
    - Typically delegate time-consuming operations by only modifying a global
      variable that is regularly checked by the main loop of the program
    - Should avoid executing code that might itself generate signals
  - Modify application standard control flow to look for the GO/NO GO flag that
    may have been modified by a signal handler
