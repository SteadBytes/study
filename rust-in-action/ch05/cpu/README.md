# 5.5 Implementing a CPU in Software to Establish that Functions are also Data

Having already implemented a CHIP-8 emulator several times (Python and Rust) it
was interesting to start from scratch with the "functions as data" perspective
demonstrated by the author in this section. This certainly helped me gain a
deeper understanding of *why* and *how* different opcodes work as apposed to
the pure mechanics of implementing an emulator from a spec sheet.
