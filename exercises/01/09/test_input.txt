In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not 
a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of 
worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, 
sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to 
eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means 
comfort. 

It had a perfectly round door like a porthole, 
painted green, with a shiny yellow brass knob in 
the exact middle. The door opened on to a 
tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a very 
comfortable tunnel without smoke, with panelled 
walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided 
with polished chairs, and lots and lots of pegs 
for hats and coats â€” the hobbit was fond of 
visitors.
