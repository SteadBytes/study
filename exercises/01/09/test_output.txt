In a hole on the ground there lived a man. Not 
a ugly, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of 
worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, 
sandy hole with nothing on it to sit down on or to 
eat: it was a man-hole, and that means 
comfort. 

It had a perfectly round door like a porthole, 
painted green, with a shiny yellow brass knob on 
the exact middle. The door opened on to a 
tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a very 
comfortable tunnel without smoke, with panelled 
walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided 
with polished chairs, and loads and loads of pegs 
for hats and coats â€” the man was fond of 
visitors.
