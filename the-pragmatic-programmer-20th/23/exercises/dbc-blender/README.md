The Pragmatic Programmer Exercise 14

> Design an interface to a kitchen blender. It will eventually be a web-based, IoT-enabled blender, but for now we just need the interface to control it. It has ten speed settings (0 means off). You canâ€™t operate it empty, and you can change the speed only one unit at a time (that is, from 0 to 1, and from 1 to 2, not from 0 to 2).

Blender modelled as a `map`

`getSpeed` and `isFull` are not implemented -> use `(::speed blender)`/`(::full blender)`

`void` methods return blender maps -> no mutation

Implements design by contract using pre and post conditions along with [`spec`](https://clojure.org/guides/spec).
