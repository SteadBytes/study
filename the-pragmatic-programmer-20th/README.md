# The Pragmatic Programmer 20th Edition

Notes/challenges/exercises from [The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition, David Thomas & Andy Hunt](https://pragprog.com/book/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition).

The majority of my work on this book can be found in my blog series on [my website](https://steadbytes.com/categories/the-pragmatic-programmer/) and [dev.to](https://dev.to/steadbytes/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition-series-1e2l). This repo mainly contains code examples to go along with blog posts where the full code was too large to include directly, as such this repo may seem incomplete as not all exercises/challenges from the book will be present here.
