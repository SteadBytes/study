# Exercise 28

`sort` directory contains source code provided by the authors for this exercise from https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/source_code. The only change made by me is adding the `[profile.release]` section
to `sort/Cargo.toml` to configure building with different optimisation levels using `opt-level`.
