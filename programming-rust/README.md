# Programming Rust

Notes, exercises and projects for studying [Programming Rust: Fast, Safe Systems
Development](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920040385.do) by Jim Blandy and Jason Orendorff.

Note: This is likely to be somewhat sparse as the book doesn't have many
projects/exercises and I'm mostly using it as a more detailed reference than
TRPL.
