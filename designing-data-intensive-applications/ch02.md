# Data Models and Query Languages

Data models inform how software is written **and** how we _think_ about the problem space.

_Layers_ of data models hide complexity of the layers below.

- Abstractions

Embody assumptions it's usage.

- Think sets (unordered, fast membership test) vs lists (ordered, slow membership test) but at all levels (layout of keys in a JSON object or columns in relational DB table e.t.c)

## Graph-Like Data Models

Appropriate for data with large amounts of many-to-many relationships

### Property Graphs

Vertex:

- Unique id
- Set of outgoing edges
- Set of incoming edges
- Properties (k-v pairs)

Edge:

- Unique id
- Tail vertex (start)
- Head vertex (end)
- Label describing the relationship
- Properties (k-v pairs)

**Cypher** = Property graph query language (Neo4j)

### Triple-Stores and SPARQL

All information stored as a **triple**: `(subject, predicate, object)`

- Subject = vertex, two representations:

  - Value in a primitive datatype

    - Predicate & object are equivalent to k-v of a property on subject Vertex

  - Another vertex
    - Predicate is an edge, subject is tail vertex and object is head vertex

**Resource Description Framework** (RDF) = Mechanism for describing data by defining relationships between data objects (using triples)

**SPARQL** = Query language for triple-stores using RDF

### Datalog

Triple-store query language pre-dating SPARQL and Cypher.
- Subset of Prolog

Represent triples as *facts* of the form: `predicate(subject, object)`
